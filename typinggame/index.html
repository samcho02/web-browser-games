                    <p> Iâ€™ve always been interested in making both my own games and websites. Games are simply fun and I enjoy playing them in my free time and websites. You see them all the time (Amazon.com, Google.com) but never get to know how they truly function. I guess in that sense, both games and websites are similar because they are always around us but we never get to see how they actually work behind the curtain. The idea to do both at once fascinated me. So here, I begin a series where I make around five to ten games on a web browser in order to get familiar with JavaScript and the frontend side of web development before I dive into backend projects. </p>
